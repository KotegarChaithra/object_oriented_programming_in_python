1. Duck Typing
2. Operator overloading
3. Method Overloading
4. Method Overriding


 **Duck Typing:**

   If the things walk like a duck, swim like a duck, act like a duck then we call duck, likewise if we have execute() in it its called Duck typing.


**Operator Overloading**

   If there is for e.g '+' operator which will inbuilt call 'sum' or 'add' method.

**Method Overloading**

   In python, if thereis a method that accepts 2 arguements and if we pass 3 values and will get error, but if we have same method name with changes in number of parameteres which is calle method overloading.

**Method overrifing**

   If son/daughter doesn't have phone and if someone asks son/daughter which phone you have and Son/daughter can say their fathers phone name, in case son/daughter purchased their new phone then any person asks which phone you have can say motorolo phone I have, which means the character overrides the fathers phone .
